# Investigation of SNP Allele Ratios in Selective Sweep Regions: Bermuda vs Domestics

This repo serves as a demonstration of a simple t-test to examine the distribution of SNP allelic ratio differences between Bermuda and Domestic chickens.

## Folders
- reports: Word documents that communicate analyses, logic, and assumptions.
- colors: 2 RGB files with craft color schemes--superior to R or RColorBrewer for heatmap visualization (author: Jun Li)  
- docs: relevant documents to aid scripted analyses (usually excel files)  
- functions: functions loaded into scripts for functionally programming  
- lit: relevant literature to analyses  
- ppt: PowerPoints supporting analyses  
- scripts: scripts, almost always in R or R Markdown. To examine scripts and get a sense of the analysis, clone the repo and open the rendered HTML files locally  
- style: .css files to aid in script rendering from R Markdown to HTML  

## Nomenclature
- File are often named with 3 parts separated by underscores:  
    - date as an identifier  
    - explanation  
    - author/editor

## How to follow the analyses
Clone the repo and examine the rendered HTML files by date for a step-by-step analysis of processing these data.
